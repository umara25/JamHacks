# LookLock

A webapp that helps you stay focused and productive with our advanced eye-tracking tool. Maximize your efficiency, eliminate distractions, and reach your goals faster.

This application was built with Streamlit and OpenCV. Streamlit was used to create the application with the necessary UI, data processing for reminders, and extra features. OpenCV was used for eye tracking and fed the information of how long the person was out of focus and how frequently that person lost focus to the application.
